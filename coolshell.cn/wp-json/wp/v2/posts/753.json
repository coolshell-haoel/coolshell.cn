The good news is that the \u201cuncoachables\u201d are easier than you think to spot. How do you know when someone is uncoachable? How do you detect a lost cause? Following are four indicators that you are dealing with one of these people:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. She doesn\u2019t think she has a problem<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>This successful adult has no interest in changing. Her behavior is working fine for her. If she doesn\u2019t care to change, you are wasting your time! Let me give you an example of a nice woman who didn\u2019t think she had a problem. My mother, a lovely woman and much-admired first-grade teacher, was so dedicated to her craft that she didn\u2019t draw the line between inside and outside the classroom. She talked to all of us, including my father, in the same slow, patient manner, using the same simple vocabulary that she used with her six-year-olds every day. One day as she graciously and methodically corrected his grammar for the millionth time, he looked at her, sighed, and said, \u201cHoney, I\u2019m 70 years old. Let it go.\u201d My father had absolutely no interest in changing. He didn\u2019t perceive a problem. So no matter how much, how hard, or how diligently she coached, he wasn\u2019t going to change.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. He is pursuing the wrong strategy for the organization<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>If this guy is already going in the wrong direction, all you\u2019re going to do with your coaching is help him get there faster.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. They\u2019re in the wrong job<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes people feel that they\u2019re in the wrong job with the wrong company. They may believe they\u2019re meant to be doing something else or that their skills are being misused. Here\u2019s a good way to determine if you\u2019re working with one of these people. Ask them, \u201cIf we shut down the company today, would you be relieved, surprised, or sad?\u201d If you hear \u2018relieved,\u2019 you\u2019ve got yourself a live one. Send them packing. You can\u2019t change the behavior of unhappy people so that they become happy: You can only fix behavior that\u2019s making people around them unhappy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. They think everyone else is the problem<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>A long time ago I had a client who, after a few high-profile employee departures, was concerned about employee morale. He had a fun, successful company and people liked the work, but feedback said that the boss played favorites in the way he compensated people. When I reported this feedback to my client, he completely surprised me. He said he agreed with the charge and thought he was right to do so. First off, I\u2019m not a compensation strategist and so I wasn\u2019t equipped to deal with this problem, but then he surprised me again. He hadn\u2019t called me to help him change; he wanted me to fix his employees. It\u2019s times like these that I find the nearest exit. It\u2019s hard to help people who don\u2019t think they have a problem. It\u2019s impossible to fix people who think someone else is the problem.<\/p>\n<p>My suggestion in cases like these? Save time, skip the heroic measures, and move on. These are arguments you can\u2019t ever win.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Life is good.<br \/>\nMarshall<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","raw":"","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u6b64\u6587\u6765\u81eaMarshall Goldsmith\u7684\u535a\u5ba2\uff0c\u6b64\u4eba\u66fe\u4efbPeter Drucker Foundation \u7684Board \u00a0member\uff08\u5b9e\u5728\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u600e\u4e48\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09&#8230;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"><a class=\"btn btn-default\" href=\"https:\/\/coolshell.cn\/articles\/753.html\"> Read More<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">  Read More<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[12,39],"tags":[],"series":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"views":6713,"post_thumbnail_image":"","content_first_image":"","post_medium_image_300":"","post_thumbnail_image_624":"","post_frist_image":"","post_medium_image":"","post_large_image":"","post_full_image":"","post_all_images":[],"videoAdId":"","listAd":"0","listAdId":"","listAdEvery":5,"total_comments":1,"category_name":"\u6280\u672f\u8bfb\u7269","post_date":"2009-05-03","like_count":"0","praiseWord":"\u9f13\u52b1","excitationAd":"0","rewardedVideoAdId":"","detailAdId":"","detailAd":"0","enterpriseMinapp":"0","audios":[],"postImageUrl":"http:\/\/coolshell.cn\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/coolshell-360x200.jpg","avatarurls":[],"related_posts":null,"pageviews":6714,"pageviews_wl":2593,"ratings_average":1,"ratings_total":9,"ratings_users":5,"next_post_id":783,"next_post_title":"\u5341\u5927\u6700\u5931\u6c34\u51c6\u7684\u79d1\u6280\u9884\u6d4b","previous_post_id":732,"previous_post_title":"Glassfish ESB \u7684\u6559\u7a0b"}
